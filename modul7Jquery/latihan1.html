  <h2>PTIK FKIP UNS</h2>

  <p id="text">
    The <span class="mark">Faculty of Teacher Training and Education, Sebelas Maret University</span>, Surakarta is an
    <span class="mark">Educational Personnel Education Institution (LPTK)</span> which has 24 study programs in 6 majors.
    Each study program has its own characteristics in producing 
    <span class="mark">superior, strong and intelligent educational staff</span>.<br><br>

    The <span class="mark">Informatics and Computer Technology Education (PTIK)</span> study program is planned to take shelter in
    the management of the <span class="mark">Engineering and Vocational Education (PTK) department</span>. 
    This placement revises our previous statement, where the PTIK study program is under the P.MIPA department. 
    PTIK is a study program that will produce graduates who are
    <span class="mark">prioritized to teach in vocational/vocational programs</span>. 
    So, it would be better if PTIK was under the PTK department which oversees vocational programs such as 
    <span class="mark">Building Engineering Education</span>, and
    <span class="mark">Mechanical Engineering Education</span>. 
    To meet the needs of lecturers in the field of information technology that cannot be met by the PTK department, 
    PTIK will conduct <span class="mark">resource sharing with the mathematics study program</span>.
